## [0.1.2] — 2026-03-01

## [0.1.1] — 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- **Database driver**: Switched from `better-sqlite3` to `bun:sqlite` in `packages/api/src/db/index.ts` — `better-sqlite3` native bindings are not supported in the Bun runtime
- **API routing**: Fixed broken `POST /api/requests` handler that was failing with 404 — replaced manual `requestsRouter.fetch()` forwarding with direct route mounting
- **Admin API paths**: Moved admin-protected routes from `/api/*` to `/api/admin/*` (requests, stats) to avoid conflicts with the public submission endpoint
- **Admin dashboard API client**: Updated all fetch calls in `packages/admin/src/lib/api.ts` to use `/api/admin/` prefix
- **Root package.json scripts**: Replaced all `bun --cwd` flags with `cd <dir> &&` — `bun --cwd` is not supported in Bun 1.3.x
- **API package.json**: Moved `better-sqlite3` and `@types/better-sqlite3` from `dependencies` to `devDependencies` (only needed by `drizzle-kit` CLI, not at runtime)
- **SPEC.md**: Updated API endpoint paths in section 4.2 to reflect the `/api/admin/` route split

### Added

- `.env` file (copied from `.env.example`) for local development
- `packages/api/data/` directory and `swag.db` SQLite database
- `packages/ssh/data/` directory with generated SSH host key
- Initial admin user seed (`admin@investec.com`)

### Updated

- **AGENTS.md**: Rewritten to match concise agent-friendly format with accurate build commands and code style notes
- **README.md**: Expanded setup instructions with macOS install steps (Bun, Go without Homebrew), direct dev server commands, API routing table, SSH host key troubleshooting tip, and `bun:sqlite` tech stack note
- **go.sum**: Updated after `go mod tidy` resolved dependency versions for the SSH server
